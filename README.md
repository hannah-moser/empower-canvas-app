# Empower Canvas App

This is a simple webapp to collect canvassing notes.

## Database Setup

Run the script in `services/db_setup.sql` to create the table necessary to store our canvassing notes.

## Running the App

To run the app, follow these steps for startup:
1. Clone this repo into your local machine
2. Ensure you've done the database setup above 
3. Open two terminal tabs
4. Navigate to the root and client directories respectively
5. Run `npm start` in both tabs
6. Navigate to [localhost:3000](localhost:3000) where you'll see the React app

From here you can add new canvassing notes and view them. If you'd like to test the API directly and see the raw json coming back, that'll be at [localhost:3001](localhost:3001)
